																<--------------------------Brick Shooting Game------------------------------>

Functioning:-
		
		There is a canon on the left boundary of the screen which can be used to shoot at bricks falling from the top boundary.
		There are also two buckets meant for collecting the bricks of same colour.
		If a black brick is collected in some bucket the game will stop.
		Also there is a reloading bar at the top right corner which shows how much the canon has reloaded once you shoot the laser.You can shoot another laser only when the reload bar is full.
		There are mirrors which can be used to reflect the lasers at desired angles.
		Also you can use mouse click and drag to move the buckets and the canon to their desired positions.
		There are sound effects for shooting laser,collision with bricks and also striking on the mirror.

		ctrl+left  :  Moves red bucket to the left
